# Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock!

I've been trying to make a game using javascript for a while. I hope you enjoy the result.

- I'm not a fan of how the game looks on screens wider than 850px. For a better gaming experience I strongly recommend you all to try it in smaller device, or just reduce the width of the browser's screen.
- A v2.0 is right around the corner. I'm looking to modify the "scoreboard" section (or remove it at all), and add a few more features in order to make the game more appealing.
- I'm open to suggestions...and donations.
